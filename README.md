# LoginPageWPF
It is application for log in and sign in in your account.
You can create and see data from data base.
In this project I use SQLite DB.
Also, in this project I use System.Data.Sqlite for work with SQLite Data Base.

## What should you do for correct work?
First of all: you need to change one string in code.

![](/src/ChangeTheString.jpg)

You need take path from here.

![](/src/Path.jpg)

## Result

![](/src/Preview.jpg)
